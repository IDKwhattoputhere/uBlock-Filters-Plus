# uBlock Filters Plus
A filterlist with additional filters for uBlock Origin.

Contains filters specific to uBlock Origin (like popunder filters) and some filters that have not yet been added to other filterlists.

Add the list from here: [subscribe](https://subscribe.adblockplus.org/?location=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IDKwhattoputhere/uBlock-Filters-Plus/master/uBlock-Filters-Plus.txt&title=uBlock%20Filters%20%2B)

Open a new issue if you want a filter to be added, changed or removed but please read this first: [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/IDKwhattoputhere/uBlock-Filters-Plus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
